## 🧐 About This GitHub

Most of my real work lives in private repositories, regulated environments, or systems where the phrase **“just push it to GitHub”** is followed by a long pause and a compliance checklist.

### As Calvin once said:

> *“I go to school, but I never learn what I want to know.”*

## 🛠 What I Work On

* **AI & ML Systems:** Mostly in healthcare (where "oops" is not an acceptable error message).
* **NLP & LLMs:** RAG pipelines with guardrails.
* **The Lifecycle:** PoC → Production → Monitoring → *“How did this ever work?”*
* **Data Sources:** Humans, wearables, EHRs, satellites, and drones.
* **Other Works:** Geospatial, UAVs, LiDAR, and GIS.

### On Programming:

> *“Programming is like magic except it’s real and can ruin your weekend.”*

## 📉 Projects, Deadlines, and Optimism

Every project starts the same way:  
**“This should be straightforward.”**

Every project ends the same way:  
**“Who wrote this?”** *“…oh.”*

Deadlines are important, but reality is more important. I design systems assuming:
1.  Requirements **will** change.
2.  Data will be **worse** than promised.
3.  Monitoring will save **future-me**.
4.  **Future-me** will still complain.

## 🧪 I Like Experimenting

I experiment a lot. Not everything becomes a repo. Not everything should.

* Some experiments fail fast.
* Some fail slowly.
* A few survive long enough to meet production.

### As Calvin wisely observed:

> *“Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere is that none of it has tried to deploy our models.”*

Hard to argue.

## 🤖 AI, ML, and a Healthy Amount of Doubt

> *“Science isn’t about certainty. It’s about being less wrong tomorrow.”* > — XKCD (hopefully)

My default assumptions:
* Accuracy without context is **dangerous**.
* Models don’t understand; they **approximate**.
* If you can’t monitor it, you don’t **own** it.
* In healthcare, **false confidence** is worse than silence.

Or, in Calvin terms:

> *“I have plenty of ideas. Execution is where they go to be tested.”*
